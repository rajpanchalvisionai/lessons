Q1: What should you do if the camera is showing as disconnected?  
A1: 
Check the camera’s LAN and power cables.  
Verify the camera assignment in the software configuration window.  
Check the IP address of the CPU or Panel PC’s LAN port.  
Check the camera’s IP address.  
Q2: What steps should be taken if the IO controller is 
disconnected?  
A2: 
Check the IO controller’s power supply.  
Verify the IP address of the CPU or Panel PC.  
Check the IP address of the IO controller.  
Ensure the IO slices or modules are properly connected.  
Q3: What should you do if the camera is not flashing when the 
trigger is received?  
A3: 
Go to the software camera settings and click on “Single Grab.” If the 
camera flashes, it means the trigger is not being received from the 
machine PLC.  
Check the physical connection of the light.  
Open the software IO settings, go to the troubleshooting section, and 
click on "LT." The signal should then be high.  
Q4: What should be verified if the primary input for the camera or 
the trigger for picture grab is not received from the machine PLC?  
A4: 
Verify the software scope view to ensure the trigger signal is being 
received.  
Q5: What should you check if broken tablets are not being 
detected?  
A5: 
Check the product threshold.

Distance : This is a dimension check, it can be helpful in detecting broken tablets and size variation in 
tablets. This is the RMS value of the combined deviation in area, length and width of the tablets.  
Shape Error : This is a shape checking parameter, it is very helpful in detecting broken tablets.  
General Tolerance :  
1) Number of Inspection: It is count of product, how many times product are inspected.  
2) Number of Rejection : Entering into to inspection area till the exit of the product from inspection 
area all the products are inspected multiple times. So if any product is rejected more than “Number 
of Rejection” count than only it will be considered as rejected product.

Transparent capsules with varying powder levels or multi -colored 
granules.  
Bi-layer tablets like white -gray on either side.  
 
Q6: What should the user do if the product color segmentation is 
not proper during Auto Teaching?  
 
A6: If the product color is not segmented correctly (i.e., the entire 
product is not highlighted), the user should go to the Threshold Tab and 
adjust the product segmentation settings as discussed in the manual 
teaching process.  
 
Q7: How does the system help with cavity and blister detection 
during Auto Teaching?  
 
A7: The system uses the Smart Symmetry method to detect blister 
positions. The user can manually adjust the cavity positions or numbering 
if needed. They can also use the "Shuffle Blister" button to visualize 
different blister configurations.  
 
Q8: What are the corrective actions if the cavity or blister 
sequence is not correct during Auto Teaching?  
 
A8: If the cavity is not positioned correctly or the blister sequence is 
incorrect, the user should:  
Go back to the relevant step (Step 2 for cavities or Step 4 for blisters) to 
adjust the positions or sequence as necessary.  
 
Q9: What happens after the Auto Teaching process is completed?  
A9: After completing Auto Teaching, the user should verify the following:  
All products are segmented properly.  
All cavities are in the correct position.  
Blisters are numbered and positioned correctly. If everything is correct, 
the user can proceed to the "Learn" tab to finalize the training.
